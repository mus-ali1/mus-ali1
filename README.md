# Hello, folks ! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mustafa Ali and I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer, currently residing in Birmingham (UK), I have 2+ years experience in teaching English combined with a Social Sciences degree in International Relations and Law. Building efficient, polished software that solves real world problems is the name of the game.  I am a naturally curious person which means I'm always keen to learn new things, a problem-solver who questions everything, and a hard worker who doesn't take life too seriously and enjoys the little things.â˜•

Some fun things about me âœ¨

- I'm a tea lover(sorry coffee heads)
- I love all things sport and a keen Boxer
- I read quite a bit and write poetry 
- I'm a movie enthusiast, especially film noir and psychological thrillers
- My weakness is fried chips
